# Release Notes

## 2026-03-25

### Sync and offline reliability
- Added automatic sync on app startup.
- Added periodic auto-sync with a configurable interval in settings.
- Added immediate sync when the browser comes back online.
- Added a persisted local task-mutation queue so offline task creates, edits, and deletes are replayed after reconnecting.
- Preserved proxy-mode compatibility for queued task replay.
- Improved offline task saves so retryable network/proxy failures are treated as queued local saves, the editor returns to the list view, and sync replay picks those entries up correctly.

### Smart lists and data integrity
- Fixed smart-list editing so saving an existing smart list updates it in place instead of creating duplicates.

### Mobile and navigation
- Moved `Sync` and `Settings` actions into the sidebar footer so they stay reachable on phones.
- Selecting a list or smart list now returns from settings to the task view on mobile.
- Fixed phone task-row metadata alignment so the project/list name aligns correctly.

### Sidebar and settings
- Added auto-sync controls to the settings page.
- Made the sidebar navigation scroll independently when many lists are present.

### Verification
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
